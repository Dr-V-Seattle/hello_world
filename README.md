# hello_world
This is the introductory exercise for GitHub (from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
The guide says to write a bit about myself... I'm a carbon-based life form, or at least, I seem to think I am. Beyond that, I don't seem to have much in common with other carbon-based life forms, except some house cats.
The areas in which I differ include 1) that I think it's too cold (everywhere, all the time), and 2) that it's been a long time since I've coded regularly.
That's about to change.

(What did you think cats were doing while you're away? They're coding in higher dimensions.)
